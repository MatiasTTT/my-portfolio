This Python script automates the extraction of PDF attachments from specific emails and renames them
into a consistent format. Its core logic was adapted from an earlier Project
but repurposed and simplified to fit the goals of this workflow. At the time of development,
it also served as an experiment to test the one-shot code generation capabilities
of the then freshly released GPT-5 language model.
