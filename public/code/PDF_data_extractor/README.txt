This Python script was developed with assistance from GPT-4 mini
for automating the gathering of information sent for customs out of numerous PDF files,
significantly accelerating a recurring task that would otherwise require
manually handpicking the data. PDF files are selected through a file dialog,
and structured details are extracted and compiled into a text report.
Errors are flagged to ensure that malformed or incomplete PDFs are clearly identified.
